      <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
      <p>
        Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock
        formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or
        harnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing", target="_blank"> traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive
        routes called “problems,” keeping climbers closer to the ground while
        solving challenging movement sequences.

      <strong>accessible to beginners</strong> and
      <strong>endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.
